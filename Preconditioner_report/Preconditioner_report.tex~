\section{Introduction}

Density functional theory in its Kohn-Sham implementation requires the use of an iterative process to converge the density. The solution depends on the input... hence one looks for the best technique to find this fixed-point (or root) within DFT. 


\section{Background Theory}


\subsection{Density Functional Theory}

Density functional theoroy (DFT) is an exact (by construction) reformulation of quantum mechanics for systems in their ground state. Its foundation are the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems... implemented in practice using the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations (hereafter `KS DFT'). Now we know we need a technique for fixing the root (or fixed point) of the density in KS DFT, we can begin to study mathematically how one can achive that, what the best methods will be, and what the pitfalls are for DFT in particular. 


\subsection{The Iterative Process for Solving a Set of Nonlinear Equations}

Many problems in Physics take the form... and KS DFT, as discussed, is no different. The SCF operator

\subsection{Linear Mixing}

Improves on fixed point iterations, but suffers from slow convergence, or sloshing instabilities.

\subsection{Pulay Mixing}

Most popular method, method in CASTEP, DIIS.

\subsection{Broyden's Methods}

Another method in CASTEP, less popular, but important prerequisite for MSB1 and MSB2. 


\section{Multisecant Broyden Methods and Their Implementation in CASTEP}

This follows the work of Marks and Luke (ref) who propose two multisecant Broyden methods (based on the good and bad Broyden method) to improve mixing. Theory of the method... Implementation into CASTEP...

\section{Results}

First compare standard techniques already in CASTEP. Give background into how they are implemented, the parameters they use, how they compare. 
Now compare to the Marks and Luke method.
